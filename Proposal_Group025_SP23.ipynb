        "Our goal is to accurately train a classifier to be able to detect fetal health problems early on in order to decrease current rates of child mortality. To accomplish this, we will be using cardiotocogram data, which are measurements taken from the fetus during pregnancy and labour like Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and number of uterine contractions per second, among many other fetal condition measurements. With this data, we will train K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and decision tree classifiers in order to recognize when a fetus health is normal, suspect, or pathological. We then will assess and select the best model so that we will be able to provide an accurate and reliable tool meant to aid in identifying and treating fetal health problems as early as possible. In order to quantify what our best model is, we will split our data into train and tests sets where the model will train with our training data and then be evaluated with our testing data. We then will use zero-one loss to judge the model's performance, which is the average number of errors across the test performances of each model, and then pick the one with the smallest average error.\n",

        "Fetal mortality is classified as the death of a fetus prior to delivery. Although it is a very prevalent issue, it is often overlooked as the public tends to focus more on infant mortality due to lack of sufficient knowledge about what causes fetal mortality and how to prevent it. Most of the data collected on fetal deaths are of the deaths that occur at 20 weeks of gestation or more and very little data is collected about deaths prior to that time. Even with the collected data, there is a lot of variation among the completeness of the data as well as the method of reporting it. According to the Center for Disease and Control (CDC), 20,854 fetal deaths that happened at 20 weeks of gestation or more were reported in the U.S. in 2020 and the fetal mortality rate for 2020 was 5.74 deaths per 1,000 live births<a name=\"Gregory\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#Gregorynote). Although a significant proportion of fetal deaths cannot be connected to a singular cause, many studies have shown that some factors that may contribute to fetal deaths include lack of access to assistance in labor and delivery, maternal conditions or complications, infections, and birth injuries, among many others. One solution for these problems could be increasing access to emergency obstetric care and access to skilled labor and delivery so that fetal deaths can be kept at a minimum <a name=\"JR\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#JRnote). Minimizing fetal health is important as it pertains to population health as a whole and can ultimately aid us in addressing and solving a variety of problems related to healthcare and access to such services beginning with infant and fetal care <a name=\"Washington State Department of Health\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#Washingtonnote).
